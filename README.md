# Pythia Shell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

This project derives from the original Pythia frontend demo app, migrating it to ELF (replacing Akita) and Angular 15.

## Docker

üê≥ Quick Docker image build:

1. ensure that you have the target locale set. This is specified in `angular.json` under `projects/pythia-shell/architect/build/options/localize`. Set it to false to use the default (English) language, or to `[it]` for Italian.
2. `npm run build-lib`;
3. if you changed anything, run `npm run xi18n` to extract the messages and merge them with the existing translations if any;
4. update version in `env.js` (and in Docker compose scripts);
5. `ng build --configuration production`;
6. if you want to create the image for the non-localized version, update [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) accordingly;
7. `docker build . -t vedph2020/pythia-shell:3.1.1-it -t vedph2020/pythia-shell:latest` (replace with the current version; remove `-it` for the English version).

>To update the localizable messages run `ng extract-i18n`. Then move the generated XLF file into locale and add new entries into the corresponding translated files in the same directory.

## Breakpoints

These are the media query breakpoints defined for responsive layouts according to the [Angular Material specs](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/blob/master/docs/documentation/Responsive-API.md) implemented by Angular Flex Layout. As this library has been obsoleted, I use them as reference for building media queries in CSS.

| name  | media query                                              |
