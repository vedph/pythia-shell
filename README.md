# Pythia Shell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

This project derives from the original Pythia frontend demo app, migrating it to ELF (replacing Akita) and Angular 15.

## Docker

üê≥ Quick Docker image build:

1. `npm run build-lib`;
2. update version in `env.js` and `ng build --configuration production`;
3. `docker build . -t vedph2020/pythia-shell:1.0.4 -t vedph2020/pythia-shell:latest` (replace with the current version).

## Breakpoints

These are the media query breakpoints defined for responsive layouts according to the [Angular Material specs](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/blob/master/docs/documentation/Responsive-API.md) implemented by Angular Flex Layout. As this library has been obsoleted, I use them as reference for building media queries in CSS.
