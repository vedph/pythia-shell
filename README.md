# Pythia Shell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

This project derives from the original Pythia frontend demo app, migrating it to ELF (replacing Akita) and Angular 15.

## Docker

üê≥ Quick **Docker image build**:

1. ensure that you have the target locale set. This is specified in `angular.json` under `projects/pythia-shell/architect/build/options/localize`. Set it to false to use the default (English) language, or to `[it]` for Italian.
2. `npm run build-lib`;
3. if you changed anything, run `npm run xi18n` to extract the messages and merge them with the existing translations if any;
4. update version in `env.js` (and in Docker compose scripts);
5. `ng build --configuration production`;
6. if you want to create the image for the non-localized version, update [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) accordingly;
7. `docker build . -t vedph2020/pythia-shell:5.0.0-it -t vedph2020/pythia-shell:latest` (replace with the current version; remove `-it` for the English version).

üåê To **update localizable messages**:

1. run `ng extract-i18n --output-path src/locale` to generate the XLF file under `src/locale`.
2. use `npx xliffmerge --profile xliffmerge.json` to merge new entries into the corresponding translated file(s) (the profile is in `xliffmerge.json`).
3. use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/download) or similar to edit the localized messages file and add the corresponding translations.

>Note that the language(s) built are defined in [angular.json](angular.json) under `configurations`. Currently, in production we build both English and Italian; in development we just build Italian. You can change the development language at will, but be sure to include the desired language(s) for production build before creating Docker images.

## Breakpoints

These are the media query breakpoints defined for responsive layouts according to the [Angular Material specs](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/blob/master/docs/documentation/Responsive-API.md) implemented by Angular Flex Layout. As this library has been obsoleted, I use them as reference for building media queries in CSS.

| name  | media query                                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|

## History

### 5.0.0

- 2024-12-10: updated Angular and packages.
- 2024-12-03:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è updated core dependencies.
  - fix to duplicate node IDs in tree view (words index): lemmata and words come from different tables, so they may often have the same ID. Now for lemmata we simply negate the ID, so that all lemmata nodes have negative IDs, and all word nodes their original positive ID.
  - refactored document reader replacing Material tree obsolete components with a paged tree. This has also the advantage of avoiding a too tall list in the map, and provide filtering for it.
  - search lemma/word from index.
  - result styles.
- 2024-12-01:
  - M3 theme.
  - updated Angular and packages except for `echarts` which must be kept at `5.4.3` with TS at `~5.5.2` until [this issue](https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts/issues/437) is fixed.
- 2024-11-22: ‚ö†Ô∏è Upgraded to Angular 19.
- 2024-11-19: updated packages.

- 2024-10-24:

### 4.0.0

- 2024-08-30: updated Angular and packages.
- 2024-08-05: updated localized messages.
- 2024-08-04:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è breaking change in progress: refactoring for new backend store (4.x.x; last release with old model is 3.1.2). All versions were bumped to 4.0.0.
  - removed terms list, replaced by new word index.
- 2024-07-15: updated Angular and packages.
- 2024-06-09:
  - updated packages.
  - added `class="mat-X"` for each `color="X"` (e.g. `class="mat-primary"` wherever there is a `color="primary"`) to allow transitioning to Angular Material M3 from M2. This also implies adding it directly to the target element, so in the case of `mat-icon` inside a `button` with `color` the class is added to `mat-icon` directly (unless the button too has the same color). This allows to keep the old M2 clients while using the new M3, because it seems that the compatibility mixin is not effective in some cases like inheritance of `color`, and in the future `color` will be replaced by `class` altogether.
  - applied [M3 theme](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).
